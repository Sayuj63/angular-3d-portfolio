            Hello! I'm Sayuj, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a keen interest in building
            exceptional digital experiences. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet,
            whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey in web development started back in [Year] when I decided to try editing
            custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me
            a lot about HTML & CSS!
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at [relevant experience].
            My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
            experiences for a variety of clients.
          </p>
